# Alsancak In Blender
A recreation of the Alsancak District and parts of Konak in Ä°zmir in Blender, with accurate building heights and satellite textures.
Used as a background for my bachelor's thesis project, [also available on github ](https://github.com/TalhaErenY/ARCH402-Final-Project)

The workflow involved a combined usage of Rhino, Autocad, and Blender. The building heights were taken from goverment survey/record data presented as a dwg, which was processed in Rhino with Grasshopper. The 3D building data was then taken to Blender with the aid of [Speckle](https://github.com/specklesystems), and satellite topographic data was downloaded within blender to be merged with.
