# Alsancak In Blender
A recreation of the Alsancak District and parts of Konak in Ä°zmir in Blender, with accurate building heights and satellite textures.
Used as a background for my bachelor's thesis project, [also available on github.](https://github.com/TalhaErenY/ARCH402-Final-Project)

The workflow involved a combined usage of Rhino, Autocad, and Blender. The building heights were taken from goverment survey/record data presented as a dwg, which was processed in Rhino with Grasshopper. The 3D building data was then taken to Blender with the aid of [Speckle](https://github.com/specklesystems), and satellite topographic data was downloaded within Blender to be merged with.



To reduce render time, the scene is split into two, the city being rendered in Eevee while the project buildings and topography is rendered in Cycles.


Even though they are in the process of being built, the renders provided by the tower projects were used as a basis to project 'the future' onto current Alsancak
